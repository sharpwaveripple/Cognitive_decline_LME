1. is the relationship b/w WMH and HA additive or synergistic?
2. if synergistic, does this extend longitudinally? 





main: does WMH volume and HPC atrophy interact to produce cognitive deficits?

1. Cross-sectional correlation matrices
2. Repeated measures ANOVA between variables longitudinally
    a. Post-hoc tests where appropriate

3 LGMs:
1. Hippocampal atrophy
2. WMH
3. The interaction
